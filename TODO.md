# RipDoc Roadmap (keep this updated!)

Feel free to add more intermediate sub-tasks as needed.

- [x] organise into subcommands
- [x] show `// ...` between search results with large distance appart
- [ ] functionality/subcommands for fetching:
  - [ ] examples
  - [x] READMEs
- [x] 'with filename' support on module list (-l) show the originating .rs path for each
  - [x] json format support for module/symbol list
    - [ ] TOON-like compact format
  - [ ] ability to dump source code files easily (without having to know path of cache registry)
    - [ ] possibly filter out/exclude comments/docstrings on source code dump as the docs would likely already be in context
